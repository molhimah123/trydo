# Story 1.2: User Logout

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to log out and stay logged out,
**so that** I can securely end my session and protect my account

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Session cleared securely

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Verify logout functionality implementation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Review existing logout implementation in AuthProvider
  - [ ] Verify `supabase.auth.signOut()` is properly called
  - [ ] Confirm session state is cleared from context
  - [ ] Test logout redirect behavior
- [ ] Task 2: Enhance logout user experience (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add logout confirmation dialog (optional enhancement)
  - [ ] Implement loading state during logout process
  - [ ] Add success feedback after logout
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of any cached data
- [ ] Task 3: Test logout functionality (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Write unit tests for logout function
  - [ ] Test logout from different pages
  - [ ] Verify session persistence after logout
  - [ ] Test logout with multiple browser tabs
- [ ] Task 4: Security validation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify JWT tokens are invalidated
  - [ ] Confirm no sensitive data remains in localStorage/sessionStorage
  - [ ] Test logout prevents access to protected routes
  - [ ] Validate proper session cleanup

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- AuthProvider context is already implemented with signOut functionality
- Logout button exists in the app dashboard (`src/app/app/page.tsx`)
- Session management is handled via `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`
- JWT token handling is managed by Supabase client automatically

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/4-api-surface-postgrest-optional-rpc.md#auth]
- Authentication via Supabase JS client (email/password, session handling)
- Logout method: `supabase.auth.signOut()` - clears session and invalidates JWT tokens
- Session handling: `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` for session updates

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/6-frontend-architecture.md#routing]
- Auth boundary: Middleware or layout guard redirects unauthenticated users
- UI patterns: Accessible inputs, focus rings, keyboard shortcuts
- Current logout implementation in `src/app/app/page.tsx` with navigation redirect

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/6-frontend-architecture.md#routing]
- Auth context: `src/components/AuthProvider.tsx` (contains signOut function)
- App dashboard: `src/app/app/page.tsx` (contains logout button)
- Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (handles route protection)
- Home page: `src/app/page.tsx` (redirects authenticated users)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/7-security.md#validation]
- Test session persistence and cleanup
- Test JWT token handling and refresh
- Verify logout prevents access to protected routes
- Test logout from different application states

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/7-security.md]
- JWT from Supabase; use `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange` to react to session updates
- HTTPS enforced (Vercel + Supabase default)
- Least privilege: Never expose service role key to client
- Proper session cleanup required for security

### Key Implementation Details
- Logout function already exists: `const { signOut } = useAuth()`
- Current implementation: `await signOut(); router.push('/auth/signin')`
- Session state managed via React context with automatic cleanup
- Supabase handles JWT token invalidation automatically

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `__tests__/` directory alongside components
- Test frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests
- Testing patterns: Mock Supabase client for unit tests, test actual logout behavior
- Specific requirements: Test logout state changes, session cleanup, redirect behavior
